PROJECT TITLE - 
Microsoft Enage 2022 Submission Project -  Recommendation Algorithms
PROJECT DESCRIPTION - 
This project is basically an algorithms based project , which includes a movie recommendation system , and it recommends movies to the user based on different recommendation Algorithms like KNN, Matrix Factorization etc. 
The project is built in Flutter frameWork (Frontend) And Python(ML Algorithms) and FASTApi to get an API that will fetch results on a request from the Algorithm. 
Why I used these technologies - 
Flutter - It is a cross platform framework , i.e. , with a single codebase , I can have a web-App , An Android Application as well as an iOS Application.
Python - I found Python suitable for implementing the ML Algorithms and also python was easy to learn for me .
FASTApi - I used it to generate an API for me , that will fetch results on the basis of requests made.
DataSet - I used the MovieLens Dataset , to perform recommendations for movies. 
Here is the link to the Dataset -  https://grouplens.org/datasets/mov
              What type of Algorithms am I using ?
             For a recommendation system , there are two types of algorithms , which can be    used - 
Collaborative Filtering - Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user. 
Content Based Filtering  - Content-based filtering uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback
	In this project i am using collaborative filtering - 
KNN Algorithm 
Matrix Factorization 


       3.   ADVANCEMENTS TO BE MADE IN THE FUTURE - 
             Right now , the project is having only two algorithms , which are being used to evaluate the results . But in the future I would like to add more algorithms , and try to compare the results and accuracy of the algorithms with each other.

HOW TO USE THE APP ON YOUR DEVICE - 
Install flutter.
Install VSCode.
Install flutter and dart packages.
Fork the repository.
In the VSCode terminal , run the following command - 
flutter run -d chrome â€˜
This will run the app in your chrome browser.
Then you can enter the names of the movies.
How the app works - 
On running the app , you will need to enter the required name to your search bar , then click on it .
